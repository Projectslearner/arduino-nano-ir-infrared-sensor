# IR Infrared Sensor

#### Project Overview

The IR Infrared Sensor project demonstrates how to use an IR sensor with an Arduino Nano to detect the presence of objects. IR sensors are commonly used for proximity sensing and object detection in various applications, including robotics, security systems, and automation. This project provides a basic setup for interfacing the IR sensor with the Arduino Nano and monitoring the sensor output via the serial monitor.

#### Components Needed

1. **Arduino Nano**
2. **IR Infrared Sensor**
3. **Jumper Wires**

### Block Diagram



#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect IR Infrared Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - Connect the signal pin of the IR sensor to digital pin 2 (or any other digital pin) on the Arduino Nano.
   - Ensure to connect the VCC pin of the IR sensor to the 5V pin on the Arduino Nano.
   - Connect the GND pin of the IR sensor to any ground (GND) pin on the Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Wire the IR sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Connect the Arduino Nano to your computer via USB.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and paste the provided code.
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.

3. **Testing:**
   - Once the code is uploaded, open the serial monitor.
   - The serial monitor will display "Object detected!" if an object is detected by the sensor, and "No object detected" otherwise.

#### Applications

- **Proximity Sensing:** Use the IR sensor for proximity detection in robotics projects to avoid obstacles or navigate environments.
- **Security Systems:** Incorporate the IR sensor into security systems to detect motion or intrusion in restricted areas.
- **Automation:** Utilize the sensor for automated systems to detect the presence of objects and trigger corresponding actions or responses.

#### Notes

- Adjust the detection range and sensitivity of the IR sensor as needed for specific applications by adjusting parameters or adding external components.
- Experiment with different IR sensor modules and configurations to optimize performance for various environments and conditions.
